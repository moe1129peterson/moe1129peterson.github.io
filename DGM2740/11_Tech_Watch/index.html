            <h3>Samsung Galaxy Tab A7</h3>

            <p>Android fans finally have a true iPad competitor, at a much more affordable price.
               Retailing for $229 (and on sale often for much less) the Galaxy Tab A7 is a great 10.4-inch tablet
               for consuming content. Whether you're browsing the web or streaming movies, you get to focus on 
               your content more, thanks to its super-thin bezels that are thinner than what you get with 
               Apple's $329 iPad. Oh, and it's got endurance to spare, lasting 13 hours and 13 minutes on 
               the Tom's Guide battery test. Oh, and it's also got an iPad Pro feature that Apple makes you pay 
               a lot for: facial recognition to unlock the device. 
               And just like Apple's pricier tablets, the Galaxy Tab A7 charges over USB-C, so you can continue to
               cut non-reversible microUSB cables out of your life. And while it's not as fast as the iPad and its
               screen isn't as bright, neither is a serious problem at this price.

            <h3>9th generation Apple iPad 2021</h3>
            <figure class="left">

            </figure>
            <p>The new 9th Gen iPad looks just like the 8th Gen update, and that's (mostly) OK. The A13 Bionic chip
               gives the 2021 iPad that necessary bump in performance to keep it speeding along, as iPadOS 15 brings
               more machine learning tricks like LiveText. The iPad's screen is still bright and colorful, and just
               what it needs at this price point. Also, Apple's sticking with its first-gen Pencil and Smart Keyboard
               Folio for its supported Apple-made accessories, which many may find easier to use 
               than third-party Bluetooth options.
               The Pencil will come in handy for Scribble-based annotation, and the keyboard will help take advantage
               of the improved keyboard shortcut support. Sound is still good, as is battery life, the only thing we
               don't like about the iPad is that the iPad mini and iPad Air are making it look even older than its design is.
            </p>

            <h3>Microsoft Surface Go 2</h3>
            <figure class="right">
                <img src="/DGM2740/11_Tech_Watch/images/MicrosoftSurfaceGo2.jpg" alt="MicrosoftSurfaceGo2">
            </figure>
            <p>Sometimes, it takes a second try to make a thing go right. The Surface Go 2 takes aim at all the flaws of 
               the predecessor and knocks them all down. First of all, thinner bezels make way for a bigger screen, 
               arguably the most important part of a tablet. The Surface Go 2 has a 10.5-inch display, compared to 10 inches for the previous model.
               The biggest upgrade is the Surface Go 2â€™s 11 hours and 39 minutes of battery life, which is over 5 hours longer
               than the original Surface Go.. Microsoft also answered my prayers for a laptop with a great webcam. 
               The 5-megapixel 1080p camera in its top bezel is great for the era of online video calls, and its second front 
               camera sensor adds Windows Hello biometric login. Finally, get the Surface Go 2 with the 8th Gen Intel Core m3 upgrade, 
               it's a little pricier at $629, but it's definitely the model for multitaskers.
